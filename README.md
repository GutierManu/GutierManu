## <p align=center>XR (AR/VR)
### <p align=center>AR Portal

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CleX8_8_PDM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CleX8_8_PDM)

A project done for learning purposes. The app allows you to use the camera to detect flat surfaces in the real world. Once these flat surfaces are detected, the user can instantiate a portal with 3 different environments available (for this project, house areas are featured).
The portal works both ways, the user is able to enter the digital environment by the front or the back side, and equally exit by any of these sides. The user is also able to exit (destroy) the environment by tapping on the pertinent button, allowing them to place the AR Portal in another position.
As an addition, Unity's localization tool has been used to add language support in English, Spanish and French.

Public release is planned in the future.

Made along the course "Introduction to Unity for 2D Videogames" by Juan Diego V√°zquez Moreno in Domestika, this prototype implements Platformer and 2D Hack and Slash mechanics. This is the very first prototype I created in my game development path, and learnt many of the fundamental principles by working on it.
