<summary><h2>About this portfolio</h2></summary>

My portfolio is organized into three categories: XR (AR/VR), 2D, and 3D. Each game/app is labeled with one of three statuses:

- Published: The game/app has been published on a determined platform or delivered directly to the client.
- Prototype: The project has some functionality that can be used in future projects or was created for learning purposes.
- Work in progress: The project is currently being developed and is planned for release in the future. </p>

In addition to the project status, each entry will specify the game engine used for its development, whether it was a collaborative or independent effort, my role/contribution, and the period for its release.

You may click/tap on the project's images to be redirected to a demo.

<p>"Honduras Ancestral" is an Augmented Reality app created in a collaborative effort with Realidad Virtual Honduras and comissioned by CANATURH. The app allows users to explore the history and culture of Honduras in a unique and exciting way.

The app focuses on two historical tourist sites in Honduras: the Ruins of Copan and the Fortress of San Fernando de Omoa. By using image markers at these sites, users can bring to life historical characters and monuments from the culture of these places and capture unique memories through photos and videos.
    
The goal of Honduras Ancestral is to inspire users to deepen their knowledge and appreciation for the cultural heritage of Honduras and Central America.

<p>A VR experience created in collaboration with Realidad Virtual Honduras for the CABEI (Central American Bank for Economic Integration) -or BCIE (Banco Centroamericano de Integraci√≥n Econ√≥mica) in Spanish-. The experience features a rollercoaster with 6 stations, each representing a diorama of the projects done by the CABEI in each of the Central American countries, including relevant data on these projects.

This project was developed as an advergame to be featured in events hosted by the CABEI

<h2 align="center">AR Portal</h2>

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/CleX8_8_PDM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CleX8_8_PDM)

<p>A project created for learning purposes. The app uses the camera to detect flat surfaces in the real world. Once these flat surfaces are detected, the user can instantiate a portal with 3 different environments available (for this project, house areas are featured).

The portal works both ways, the user is able to enter the digital environment by the front or the back side, and equally exit by any of these sides. The user is also able to exit (destroy) the environment by tapping on the pertinent button, allowing them to place the AR Portal in different position.

As an addition, Unity's localization tool has been used to add language support in English, Spanish and French.

<h2 align="center">Character Customization</h2>

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/uaw7ap6sOME/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uaw7ap6sOME)
    
<p>This is a prototype for a character customization screen. The whole functionality can be reused and adapted to different 2D projects where characters or objects may require customization.

This prototype went through two versions: the first one handled the customization by creating sprites from textures at runtime (through code) and PlayerPrefs was used for saving progress. The second version, which is way more optimal, handles customization and progress through scriptable objects; a complete refactor on the customization system was performed for this to be possible, making it easier to keep adding more customizable assets in this or a different 2D project.

The prototype also uses the system's date and time to handle a day/night cycle, changing the ambient's color depending on the time of the day. Additionally, a shop and inventory system was created.

This project also showcases the use of a dynamic scroll view to generate buttons that represent different customization options based on player choices. This functionality enables players to navigate seamlessly through available customization options, improving the overall user experience. By dynamically generating buttons that correspond to specific customizable features, this scroll view feature is an excellent example of how to enhance a game's usability by implementing practical and effective user interface design.

While there is still room for improvement, such as enhancing the visuals of the UI, the potential for this feature is exciting, and further development will only enhance its possibilities.

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/FHEM14KuGVg/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/FHEM14KuGVg)

<p>This prototype was created as part of my game development journey and was made in conjunction with the course "Introduction to Unity for 2D Videogames" by Juan Diego V√°zquez Moreno on Domestika. The project implements both Platformer and 2D Hack and Slash mechanics, providing an opportunity for me to learn the fundamental principles of game development through practical experience. This prototype represents an important milestone in my game development journey and has provided me with a solid foundation to build upon.</p>

<p>These projects were developed for the purpose of learning and understanding key concepts and topics in game development. While the design and mechanics may be simple, they serve as practical examples of the principles learned throughout the course of study. By implementing the concepts learned in a practical way, these projects provide valuable hands-on experience and help solidify understanding of the topics covered. Through experimentation, iteration, and the application of theoretical knowledge, these projects serve as stepping stones towards more complex and polished games in the future.
